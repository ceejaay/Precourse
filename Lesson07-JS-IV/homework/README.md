# Homework #JSIV

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects - An object is a computer thing that can hold information. Sometimes you need an easy way to move things like phone numbers and names from person to person via computer. An object wraps up that information in a little package that you can send to another computer or person. The programmer, the person who writes instruction for a computer, can write tools for Javascript objects. It makes it so you can do things to the object to make things easy for people to read  on phones and the internet.
	* Properties - Properties are the names of the  bits of information in the object. It's like a label. You can call a property anything. Like, name or phone number or cat name. You can name the property and give it a value. An example of property is address. The value of the address is 225 Main Street.
	* Methods - methods are like a tool for an object. Methods help the programmer do things to the information in the object properties. If you need to do hard things to the information in the objects, a method can make the job easier. Suppose you need to multiply large numbers. A programmer can write a method to do the job.
	* for in loop  Objects have a group of things called properties. Sometimes you need to look at all the properties at once. So the for-in loop helps us look at all the properties or the information in the object. You say it like this For Key(you use this word to stand in for the properties.) In- you use this to name the object. This loops through all the properties and you can use different tools to work with the data in the Object.
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSIV.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
