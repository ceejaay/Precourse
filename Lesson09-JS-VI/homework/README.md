# Homework #JSVI

## Instructions
## Done with writing prompts
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Callback Functions A callback function is a tool used by javascript that uses another tool to do it's job. It's like using a hammer to help turn a wrench.(don't do this!!) Sometimes you need a tool to one job, then you need another tool to do a job on the thing both at the same time. 

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSVI.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
