# Homework #JSV

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* `prototype`
        A prototype is like a box of tools. Each one does a different job. The worker or the Javascript object can use these prototypes or tools to do jobs. Like if a 'worker' needs to captialize a word. The worker uses a tool called captialize. The worker uses the tool and the word gets capitalized. The programmer can even make special tools for the worker. If a worker needs a special tool. The programmer can make one for the worker.
	* Constructors
      Constructors are like a robot that can build a lot of the same thing. In javascript we call these things 'objects'. The programer makes a Constructor that makes objects. If you want  a robot to build a house. You tell the robot or construtor to build a house with four walls and a roof. After the programer builds the robot or constructor. The robot/constructor can build as many houses as you need. The programmer can also build tools for your robot to use on the house. That's what a prototype is.

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSV.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
