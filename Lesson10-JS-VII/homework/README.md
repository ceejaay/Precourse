# Homework #JSVII

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Closure - Closure is when you have a machine that does a couple of jobs. Think of a function as a machine. You put in inputs, like say the wet and dry ingredients of a cake. If you mix them in the wrong order, your cake might not be so good. But if you have a machine that does everything in careful order, your cake turns out well. So inside your cake machine you have a machine for mixing the dry ingredients. Then you have another maching that mixes the wet ingredients. Then the machine puts out or returns  the cake batter all mixed together properly. 
    * Closure is like that. You have a function. It runs data through a series of steps. Sometimes you have to break up those steps. You can put a function inside the larger function to do some of those steps.
    * Closure's help protect some data from other functions and methods. Think of JS like an open field with a lot of toys on it. Some of the toys you can use with no problem. You can use the bat and ball together. But if there's a videogame machine on the field too, you can't use the virtual baseball to play baseball with the real bat. 
	
*** Stretch Goals: Everything after this line is optional ***
*** These tests are optional, any work you do to comeplete these tests is extra. That being said, having  exposure to these concepts and attempting them is recommended. The better you understand these concepts, the better your experience will be at Lambda School. ***  
2. Uncoment lines 7 through 56 in the file `JSVII.test.js` from the `__tests__` folder within this `homework` folder. Then, from the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSVII.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
