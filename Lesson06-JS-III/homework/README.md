1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Arrays:  Imagine a library. The library is filled with books. Your average library is neatly organized. An array is like a library. But there are very few rules for organizing an array. In a lbrary you find a book by searching the computer. Or you ask the librarian for help. In an array you can store any kind of information you want. You can have a number. Or a word. If you wanted you could store your name and address and zodiac sign in the array. In a library you have to keep things in order. In an array, Javascript allows you to keep anything in an array, in any order. Array's can be as big or as small as you want. You can also keep any kind of information in them. A library has books magazines dvds and music. Arrays can contain that information too. You can also keep Javascript objects in arrays. Objects are groups of information. There are really no rules about what kind of info you keep in an array. You just have to have a plan to access it. You can check each slot in an array to see what's there. You can look at slot 0 or slot 99. The computer can tell you what's in each of those numbered slots. If there's nothing ther, the couputer will tell you that too. Array's come with tools to manage the data  in them. There are tools to change evrything in them to a string. There are tools to multiply every number in an array by another number. Arrays are just one way to organize data in Javascript.

2. 3. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSIII.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
